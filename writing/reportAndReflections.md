Question 7.

After doing research on the topic specifically from the link provided below it is evident that there are many diseases that vacinnes have helped slow the death rate of. First of when looking at the first graph on the website it is important to note that it shows the number of people vacinnated of the year and is shows the increasing rate of people. Later on in the article it shows the main diseases and the decreasing rate of deaths occuring from these diseases. Some to note are Tuberculosis and Tetnus. Thus one would be able to say that they two are correlated and that due to the increase in the vacination and find vaccinations for these diseases it has lead to a much lower death rate of people. I am convinced by this data and by the work because it seems evident that this much data must mean that vacinnes are helping stop the deaths of these diseases.

Question 8.

a. What is the damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article
which states (incorrectly) that autism is a result of vaccines?

When an article states that something like autism is a result of vaccines this will greately influence the public. When something like this comes out people will obviously stop getting vacinnes and will veiw doctors in less of a high standard. This would make doctors look really bad and damage their credibility if what they are doing causes something as severe as autism. However it was incorrectly stated but this still effects public medicane and the public opinion because it cause them to second guess this issue.

b. What should the role of academic research groups and organizations be to ensure that
published information is absolutely correct (i.e., has been properly analyzed) before
public exposure?

Academic research groups should have to study in great detail these types of articles before they get published because the effect is so high. They should make sure first that the data is analyzed correctly and thoroghly so that no mistakes could have been made. They could implement rules and steps that need to be taken before articles of this magnitude are allowed to be published. This is a big problem that needs to be addressed.

c. The researcher retracted his paper, which means that he no longer supports its content.
Is retracting a paper enough to fix the damage to public medicine? How could the
damage be fixed if this you do not think that this is enough?

This is probably not enough to fix the demage that has been done. Some people might not know that he retracted this along with the fact that just the thought of this being true could affect individuals. The only way I beleive that could fix the damage is if a study would come out on how the two obviously do not correlate and that vacinnes are not the cause of autism.

Question 9.

Below are two data sets that could be used to annalyze vacinnes and if they are beneficial.

Question 10.

The talk was very imformative and allowed me to gain a lot of insight on health and health data. I learned that it is used a lot and it is very informative on what effects what. However an idea that really stuck with me is that when analyzing health data you have to be careful because you can basically say that anything effects anything becaue you can make the data look that way. This could actually not be the case and two things may not effect eachother at all. So basically that most important thing I took from the talk is that yes it is useful to use data in health but make sure you really analyze that data going into depth and studying it because it is easy to get false results and results that will not actually be accurate.
